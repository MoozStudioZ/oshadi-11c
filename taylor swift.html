<B><P>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her biographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread public interest.</P>

Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005 starting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). Their singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She experimented with rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later recalibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop album 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood" and "Look What You Made Me Do".</P>

Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), explored indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, and subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024). She re-recorded four of her albums as Taylor's Version[a] due to an ownership dispute with Big Machine. The albums garnered the US number one songs "Cardigan", "Willow", "All Too Well", "Anti-Hero", "Cruel Summer", "Is It Over Now?", and "Fortnight" in the 2020s. Her sixth concert tour, the Eras Tour (2023â€“2024) and its accompanying concert film are respectively the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time.</P>

Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with a record seven albums that sold over one million copies first-week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the first billionaire with music as primary income, and the world's richest female musician. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 39 Billboard Music Awards, and 30 MTV Video Music Awards; she has won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year at least four times each. Swift is an advocate of artists' rights and women's empowerment, and maintains a close relationship with her fanbase, the Swifties.</P>

<p>Taylor Swift has released 11 distinct albums throughout her career (and rerecorded four of them). BI's senior music reporter ranked them from worst to best, using a Swift-specific scoring method. "Folklore" took the top spot, while her latest, "The Tortured Poets Department," is in fourth place.

<dt><u><center>Folklore (Taylor Swift album)</center></u><br>
<center><img src=".\Saved Pictures\taylor.png" width="400" height="300">
<P>Folklore is the eighth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was surprise-released on July 24, 2020, via Republic Records. Swift recorded her vocals in her Los Angeles home studio and worked virtually with the producers Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff, who operated from their studios in the Hudson Valley and New York City.

Conceived during quarantine in early 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Folklore explores themes of escapism, nostalgia, and romanticism. Using a set of characters and story arcs to depict fictional narratives, it departs from the autobiographical songwriting that had characterized Swift's past albums. Experimenting with new musical styles for Swift, Folklore consists of mellow ballads driven by piano, strings, and muted percussions; music critics mostly classify the genre as indie folk and alternative rock. The album's title was inspired by the lasting legacy of folktales, and its visual aesthetic adopts cottagecore.

Folklore was accompanied by the concert documentary Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, featuring Swift's commentary and performances. The album topped the charts in Australasia and various European countries, and it was certified platinum or higher in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it spent eight weeks atop the Billboard 200 and was the best-selling album of 2020. Three songs, "Cardigan", "The 1", and "Exile" featuring Bon Iver, reached the top 10 on international singles charts, with "Cardigan" peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

Folklore received widespread critical acclaim for its emotional weight and intricate lyricism; some journalists commented that its introspective tone was timely for the pandemic and regarded its sound as a bold reinvention of Swift's artistry. Many publications featured the album on their 2020 year-end rankings, and Rolling Stone included it in their 2023 revision of their "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" list. Folklore won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman to win the honor three times. The album informed the concept of Swift's next record, Evermore (2020), boosted Dessner's reputation, and has inspired other artists' works.</p><br>
